1. Action -> 
Action are plain JavaScript object that have a type filed, Action only tell what to do, but they don't tell how to do

1.1 Action Creator -> 
Action Creator is a pure funtion which creates an Action

2. Reducer ->
Reducer are funtion that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result.

3. Store -> 
The Redux store brings together the state actions and reducer that make up your app.
it's important to note that youill only have a single store in a Redux appliction.

Every Redux store has a single root reducer funtion.



Redux Principles ->

single source of thruth -> The global state of your appliction is sotred as an object inside a single store

state is Read-Only -> The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action

Immutability, One-Way Data flow predictability of outcome

Changes are Made with pure Reducer funtion.
